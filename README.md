# CircuitPy
THIS... is where I will store code for working on my CircuitPython stuff <br>
Currently I'm using the following:
  * Adafruit Feather RP2040 
  * Adafruit TSL2591 Light Sensor 
  * Adafruit 128x64 OLED FeatherWing
  
  ### How it started

### How it's going

### Left to do/random ideas
- [ ] Add in display button utilization to update display
- [ ] More arrangement of screen elements
- [ ] Lux to EV
- [ ] EV to Camera exposure settings
- [ ] Get battery level
- [ ] Display Bettery level

Eventually I want to work up to where I can have 3 or 4 buttons.\
UP - Cycle between Av, Tv, P, ISO priority
SEL - hold to change mode
DWN - Cycle between Av, Tv, P, ISO priority
REC - Take light measurement

### Nov 2021 Update

  - Major overhaul to directories.
  - I broke my display, so we've rotated "270" degrees and moved boxed around.
  - "code.py" is just where I have different "pages" setup and button presses to switch/update them.
  - lightmeter-beta.py will be where my main code for the end-goal (a functioning light meter) will live.
